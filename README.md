# Express.js JSON Body Parsing Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with JSON request bodies in Express.js applications. The problem arises when the application fails to correctly parse the incoming JSON data, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

## Bug Description
The provided Express.js application attempts to handle POST requests containing JSON data. However, due to a missing or incorrectly configured body-parsing middleware, the `req.body` object remains empty, causing the application to fail to process the JSON data correctly. 

## Solution
The solution involves adding the correct middleware to parse JSON data before accessing the `req.body` object.  This usually involves using `express.json()`.
